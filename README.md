# Rådgiver app powered by ZIO

Rådgiver is a recommendation service that analyzes event feeds from the Deichman Library to tailor event suggestions based on user interests. Utilizing the ZIO library in Scala, Radgiver processes and filters event data to match user profiles, ensuring personalized recommendations. The service provides a RESTful API for interaction, allowing users to receive curated event lists that align with their preferences, enhancing their experience with relevant cultural and educational activities.
